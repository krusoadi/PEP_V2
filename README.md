# Spotify Playlist Generator Project

## Basic infos

This project is made for my Prompt Engineering class atu BME. With this project I've learned the basics of Spotipy and Openai python libraries. WIth this project I'm also learning how to use Github, and Github Copilot efficiently for my studies.

## Used extensions, etc.

### Comments

The comments are coloured by "Better Comments" VSCode extension. The "#?" comments are descriptions for variables. The "#!" comments are warnings, and the "#TODO" comments mark unfinished methods and files.

### Github Copilot

I've used Github Copilot, for the comments, Docstrings and to generate more readable codes.
